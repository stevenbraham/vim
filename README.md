# About
This my vim configuration. I don't use Vim als my main IDE, but still frequently for creating simple applications or quickly editing files.

# Color scheme

Currently I use the [Paper color theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) 

# Plugins

I manage my plugins with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
